# templates-and-polymorphism
With my classmate we work on 6 exercises about templates and polymorphism.
The first exercise was about one-dimensional bezier curves so we have to create a class to manipulate these curves. 
The second one was to make the first program more generic by replacing the bezier classes by template.
The third one was to use and understand two-dimensional bezier curves.
The fourth exercise was to work with QT interface 
The fifth one was about polymorphism, we had to, with a scene of 2D objects, to point somewere on the scene and find the closest object. 
The last one was to use QT interface, polymorphism and templates on the same exercise to have complet and complexe code.
